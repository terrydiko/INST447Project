If there are drivers doing the limit, and there is a driver driving recklessly, an accident can be caused due the increase in speed. Our hypothesis can be confirmed by looking at the end of the graph. Roads with 70mph have the lowest amount of accident counts. This supports our hypothesis because in the 70mph roads, everyone is going at a higher rate of speed consistently, decreasing the chance of accident. However, for the roads with a lower limit, some drivers may be impatient and decide to go above posted speed, which can cause a crash with drivers following the posted speed.\"\n",

An increase in traffice can lead to more accidents. Lower speed limits can be ignored by drivers at times. If an area has a low rate of speed, the driver may drive faster to get through the area quicker. However, their speed now becomes an outlier to the drivers that are doing the posted speed, which can cause an increase in accidents. Lastly, direction can play a part in the number of accidents if many people are traveling in the same direction at once.
